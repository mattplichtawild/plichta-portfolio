    "bio":"I started my professional career as a tiger trainer. My creative drive to solve problems led me to starting the WildHeart Foundation, a nonprofit with the goal of improving the lives of wild animals in captivity. As a founder and leader, I spearheaded new programs to raise donations in unique ways. It was through this work that I discovered my love of programming by building WildWish.org, an application to connect donors directly to the animals they are helping. I believe I am in this world for a purpose, and that purpose is to make the world a better place. I achieve this through my work of building products that enrich the lives of animals and people alike.",
